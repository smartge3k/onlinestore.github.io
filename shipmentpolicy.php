						Unless otherwise indicated at the time of ordering or by subsequent notification from us, shipments will be made via a carrier that we select, or if we give you a choice of shipping method, the carrier that you select. If you choose an express delivery service, an additional charge will be imposed at the time of your order. If your order is accepted and the items selected are in stock, your order will normally ship within the time indicated on our website. All ship and delivery dates specified on our website are estimates only and are subject to change. We do not guarantee delivery dates, and we are not responsible for delays by the carrier. Risk of loss and title to ordered items pass to you upon delivery to the shipping carrier. Inspect your shipment upon arrival. Report any shipping-related damage immediately to the carrier. <br>
